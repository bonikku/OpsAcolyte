# OpsAcolyte

An app showing pending tasks to-do in a specific shift. Initially created as a webapp to help in my previous job.

Currently unfinished although, the core features are fully implemented which are:
** OmniAuth logging with facebook, github, google and twitter
** Users created with devise and :lockable
** Creating a shift, work center and tasks
** Many to many relationships like on the diagram below
